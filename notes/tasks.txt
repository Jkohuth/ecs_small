    "Use" keyword needs implementation 

        Use Canister - triggers a flag on the door, prints a message
        Use Rock - Used in window location triggers the ending of the game
        Use watch - Displays how much time before a game over
        Use Lighter: Update_Door_System handles these calls
            Triggers the end of the game by the door component if the canister flag is set
            Triggers a hint when the player attempted to use it without using the canister first at the correct location
