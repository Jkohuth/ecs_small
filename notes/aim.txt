This is a side project that will eventually be rolled into my modular ECS game engine. My lack of experience with ECS made me want to attempt
to create a small standalone game using those concepts. 

Goal: A text based adventure game organized in an ECS fashion.
    Load/Store a grouping of Entities with certain components
    Main event cycles through the different Systems every tick.
    Those systems apply updates to inidivual components 
    
    Game should take end user input via certain commands.
