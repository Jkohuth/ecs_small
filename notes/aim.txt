This is a side project that will eventually be rolled into my modular ECS game engine. My lack of experience with ECS made me want to attempt
to create a small standalone game using those concepts. 

Goal: A text based adventure game organized in an ECS fashion.
    Load/Store a grouping of Entities with certain components
    Main event cycles through the different Systems every tick.
    Those systems apply updates to inidivual components 
    
    Game should take end user input via certain commands.

    Gather Information on how to store loaded Entities and Components

27-10-2021
    I've gotten my storage system based on an example system implemented. I can now store components and Entities
    and run systems iterating on the available data.

    Now I need to take in input and edit the individual components. I also need to edit on entities that contain specifically 2 components

    Update, we are now able to edit individual components/entites based on user input
